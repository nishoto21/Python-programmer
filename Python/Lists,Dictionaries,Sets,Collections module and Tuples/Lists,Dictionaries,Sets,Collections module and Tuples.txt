DEFAULTDICT


PROBLEM

Creating an empty list for missing data


# Create an empty dictionary: ridership
ridership = {}

# Iterate over the entries
for date, stop, riders in entries:
    # Check to see if date is already in the ridership dictionary
    if date not in ridership:
        # Create an empty list for any missing date
        ridership[date] = []
    # Append the stop and riders as a tuple to the date keys list
    ridership[date].append((stop, riders))
    
# Print the ridership for '03/09/2016'
print(ridership['03/09/2016'])


SOLUTION 

Using default dict.


# Import defaultdict
from collections import defaultdict

# Create a defaultdict with a default type of list: ridership
ridership = defaultdict(list)

# Iterate over the entries
for date, stop, riders in entries:
    # Use the stop as the key of ridership and append the riders to its value
    ridership[stop].append(riders)
    
# Print the first 10 items of the ridership dictionary
print(list(ridership.items())[:10])
